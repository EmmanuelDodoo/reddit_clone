# Reddit Clone

## Description

This project is a solution to a problem I was having.

Problem: I waste too much time on Reddit.

Solution: Make a clone of the app as justification for spending even more time on there.

## Current Features

As one would expect from a modern social media app (or a clone of one), my app currently features:

1. A beautiful and modern UI (thank you material 3!) with a number of custom themes each with light and dark modes.

2. Support for both text and images. Video and audio support was a bit much for now but I may return to implement this.

3. Like and Dislike functionality to make others feel your benevolence or more likely ire.

4. Community building functionality with subscriptions.

## Future Goals

Should I ever return to this project. I hope to implement these:

1. Notifications, saving and sharing.

2. Auto Dark mode

3. An interface without drawers. Drawers make navigation on Android not enjoyable.

4. Fix some rebuilding issues on the home page

## Disclaimer

I have no intention of commercialising this project and only made this for fun. (Please don't sue me üò•üôèüôè)

Feel free to use this project as you wish.
